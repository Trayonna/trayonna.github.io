<p>People of China, Uganda, Nicaragua, Liberia and other countries stood outside of the United Nations headquarters surrounded by police officers, metal and wooden barricades, painted signs, and bull horns, all seeming to shout for the same thing, change.</p>

<p>“This is a global world, everybody here are coming here to say to their government we need change, we need change today and we want to move forward. In order for the country to move forward we have to have change”, said Cecelia Hippe, a Liberian woman participant of the protest.</p>

<p>According to Hippe and other Liberian’s surrounding her, their government extorted $16 billion from their people.  When their officials walked over to their protests there was an immediate uproar of shouting saying things like “You stole from our people”, “Justice for Liberia”, “Our people are dying”.</p>

<blockquote>“Our people are dying”.</blockquote>

<p>Death was a common thread between these countries protestors.
“Red equals blood” said Moses Sennyondo, 33, of Uganda who stood next to a fellow Ugandan holding a sign that said, “Stop the killing fields in Uganda by Museveni”.</p>

<p>In spite of the tragic causes that led these people to come out and voice their outrage, there was a display of unity and respect between the individuals from each country.</p>

  <p>“This was a very nice place of meeting because you have people from different countries raising their voices, we need to make a better world”, said Sennyondo.
  “When you stand together and work together you can make a difference”.</p>

  <p>Walking out of the protest wearing a red, yellow, and green flag wrapped around her neck, Gabriella Tizoni, a Bolivian woman had similar thoughts. Smiling and nodding at people from the other countries and holding a wrinkled white cardboard sign that had “El 21 De Fe Se Respeta Bolivia Dijo No” written in paint, Tizoni said, “We just want the best for our countries”.</p>
