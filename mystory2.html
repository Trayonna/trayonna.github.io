<p>As the new year quickly approaches new year resolutions are accompanied with new shopping deals for shoppers, new advertisements for consumers
and new mta fares for commuters. The transit fare is anticipated to increase by four percent in 2019, according to nbcnewyork.com.
The single ride fare price has been the same for the past three years, but in this upcoming year that price will change.</p>

<p>The current single ride fare price is $2.75 which is over 30% more than the price in 2009
Over the years the transit system fare has increased from $0.05 in 1904 to now $2.75.
This past summer Spectrum News said that fare and toll increases of 4 percent are in store,
and will not be as large as the rate of inflation.</p>

<blockquote>What is the rate of inflation?</blockquote>

<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers rose 2.0 percent over the year.
The first CPI for 2019 will be released in February of 2019,which will show the rate of inflation for the year.
